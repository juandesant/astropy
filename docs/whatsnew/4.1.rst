**************************

Overview
========

Astropy 4.1 is a major release that contains bug fixes and new features since
the 4.0.x series of releases.

In particular, this release includes:

1. Support for the ``-TAB`` algorithm in FITS WCS as described in
   `WCS Paper III <https://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/scs.pdf>`__ .
   In particular, ``astropy.wcs`` will be able to support ``-TAB`` in WCS if
   already defined in the ``astropy.io.fits.HDUList`` object.
